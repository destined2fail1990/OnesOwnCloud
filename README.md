# Containers
A simple docker container, or set of docker containers, used to provide services to the end user's private network - including their cell phone and mobile devices. Optionally, they can add as many family members as they would like to their private cloud seamlessly.

# Pairs/Sets?
Containers can come in pairs or sets. With a type to identify where they run, for example 

# Example
I'm running Docker Desktop currently because I needed a server for Jabber/XMPP to chat privately. It is a hassle to install Docker somewhat and configure it all, especially for a typical consumer. 

If, for instance, I was able to quickly install it and have UPnP (ew) set up the ports or have it thrown out into the cloud, the setup would take minutes. Not hours. Akin to existing app stores.
